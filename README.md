# NIIT-Pygame
Here I have made some games using python pygame module.

1. Tic-Tac-toe:
  <br/> Rules of the Game-
      `One of the player chooses 'O' and the other 'X' to mark their respective cells. 
      The game starts with one of the players and the game ends when one of the players has one 
      whole row/ column/ diagonal filled with his/her respective character ('O' or 'X'). 
      If no one wins, then the game is said to be draw.
      Press R to  Restart the game.`
